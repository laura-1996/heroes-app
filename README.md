### Author comment
Hello! I'm Laura, a junior frontend developer with passion and curiosity for programming and UI/UX design.
I've made this project with Vue.js and I really enjoyed it especially because it was challenging and new for me.
I've used axios for the API calls and Vue Router for the routing of the webpage.
For the style part I've decided to nest the style in the components and I've used both grid and flexbox for the various containers.
The homepage performs a call and get the data about the first 30 art objects in the collection just to give the user some advices. 
The searchbox on the top right of the screen does an other call with the query passed from the user and it shows other 30 results.
The components has also a loading property in order to display them once the data have arrived.
I hope you like the hover effect over the cards in the homepage!
